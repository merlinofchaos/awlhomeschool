<h2>Support</h2>
<p>We consider our park day a weekly recess for our children.  While our children play, parents support each other in our homeschooling endeavors.  If you're having trouble figuring out what curriculum to use, or dealing with parenting challenges, there are plenty of people in our group to help guide and support you.</p>

<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>We are an inclusive group and we benefit from a variety of individuals that comprise our membership. If you would like to visit our group, please apply by <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/awl-homeschool-park-day">signing up at our Google Group</a>.
